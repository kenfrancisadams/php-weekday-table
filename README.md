# php-weekday-table
PHP code to create a simple HTML table with dates and periods for a specified range - useful for school timetables.

It's currently very basic. You give it a start date, an end date, how many periods you have in a day and whether or not you want to include a morning registration period first and it will generate a table for you.

You need to make sure the start date is a Monday and the end date is a Friday otherwise the table breaks.

Here's a preview image of the output:
