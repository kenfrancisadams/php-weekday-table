# php-weekday-table
PHP code to create an table with dates and periods - useful for school timetables.

It's currently very basic. You give it a start date and an end date and it will calculate the rest.

Here's a preview image of the output:

Currently, if you want to customise the number of periods in a day you need to remove \<td\> tags but I want to add variables to do this stuff soon.
